# Flashlight 📖

This project was developed during the Decola Tech 3rd edition bootcamp on 
the Digital innovation one platform. In the initial project that was proposed, you 
were able to shake your hand to activate your mobile's flashlight and change the theme of your
application. In this project I removed this functionality and added a new one, in which you click
on the application icon and a click counter starts, which increases the speed at which the theme
and flashlight alternate between active and non-active.
The maximum number of clicks is six times, going from six 
the value of the counter goes back to zero.

## What I learned 🧑‍💻

It was my first project developed with React native , as I already have a solid base of
react on the web, it was not difficult to understand some concepts. The hardest part was
realizing that there are differences between what you can do on the web and on mobile with
react. Also in development you should pay attention to some things, for example, some interfaces
will be great on android devices but the same interface can break on IOS devices.
